What is Context api in react? Refer: https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html
There are situations where some compoenent values are required by all the componenets in the componenet structure, like curret_user, ui theme,etc.

Tradionally, we pass the values in a top-down (parent to child) in the form of props.
This can be difficult to assign props for each compoenet to access a certain value that is common across the child elements.

Context lets us pass value deep into the compoennet tre, without explicitly threading it thru each compoenent.

1. First create the context using the React.createContext('light');
2. Use 'Provider' to pass the current theme to the tree below.

Context api usuage:
1. Craete a file called context.js that is where the Context Provider and Consumer are created.

2. In context.js, we create Provider class
const Context = React.createContext();
export class Provider extends Component{
    state={
        what ever value you want to pass down
    }
    render(){
        <Context.Provider value={this.state}>
            {this.props.childer}
        </Contexr.Provider>
    }

}

//this to able to be consumed by all the componenet;(the value in the Context.Provider)
export const Consumer = Context.Consumer;

3. import this context .js file and use the Consumer object and get the value(this.state) which was defined in the Context.Provider.

4. All of the code needs to be wrapped under the Provider tag in App.js.
